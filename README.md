### Abstract 

Blindness or visual impairment is a functional limitation of the eyes that has an impact on 
people, particularly children. Children in pre-school age with vision impairment can have 
delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development. This can have a strong 
effect on their future life. Assistive technology can improve their condition and help them and 
their parents. Accessible mobile apps can meet their needs and offer them a chance to learn like 
sighted children. In this project, we will develop an inclusive app that is accessible by blind 
preschoolers. Our application will teach children about numbers and the basics of counting 
through an interactive game that provides non-visual feedback
